# occupancy_map_cpp
I write a simple GUI with opencv-python to transfer ROS occupancy map into smaller grid map, and use darp algorithm for coverage path planning.

# Reference

# How to use
1. Install the required packages.
2. Replace the file path with your own
3. Execute the file process.py
4. Double left-clicks to select initial positions for robots, and double right-clicks to delete.
5. Slide the upper two trackbars to process the map.
6. Slide the last trackbar to generate paths.
